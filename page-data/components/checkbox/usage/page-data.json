The parent remains unchecked if no child is checked. \n\nIndeterminate state of the parent shows a partially checked state when there is a nested relationship.

For example in forms etc.\n\n![Checkbox vs. switch](./images/checkbox-3.png)\n<br/>\n\n#### Checkbox vs. Dropdown\nCheckboxes should be used when there are fewer than 5 options as they are easy to scan and save an additional click of opening a dropdown.\n\nHowever, if the number of options exceeds 5 or if the space is limited then it is recommended to use dropdowns.\n\n![Checkbox vs. dropdown](./images/checkbox-4.png)\n<br/>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"7efd50381246e56c9e1fbb33e1a40f54","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1717},"frontmatter":{"title":"Checkbox","description":"Checkbox lets users select one or more values.","tabs":["Usage","Code"],"showMobile":true},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Checkbox\ndescription: Checkbox lets users select one or more values.\ntabs: [\"Usage\", \"Code\"]\nshowMobile: true\n---\n\nCheckboxes lets users select one or more values from a list of options.
