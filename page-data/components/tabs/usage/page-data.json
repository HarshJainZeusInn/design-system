Don’t use tabs to group content that is dissimilar.\n\n![Tabs have similar kind of content and act as filters](./images/tabs-2.png)\n\n<br/>\n\nOn the other hand, navigation menu items are generally used to group independent pages.\n\n![Navigation represents independent pages](./images/tabs-3.png)\n\n<br/>\n\nIf **navigation items and tabs** are used on the same page make sure to use them in such a way that while switching between multiple tabs, the user stays on the same page and sees relative data whereas while switching between multiple navigation items, the user is taken to a new page which may or may not be relative.\n\n![Tabs and navigation on the same page](./images/tabs-4.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Tabs within other components\n\nTabs are usually paired with components like headers or nested in components like cards, modals, and sidesheets.\n\n![With page header](./images/tabs-5.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n![In a modal](./images/tabs-6.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n![In a card](./images/tabs-7.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Tab Label\n\nTabs should have short and scannable labels, generally limited to a single word. \n\n#### Maximum Tabs\n\nToo many tabs can unnecessarily clutter the UI. Hence it is recommended **not to use more than 5 tabs** at once.\n\n\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"3f5f8dbf36b7cb1059d13eb5b66d98e9","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1654},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tabs","description":"Tabs segregate similar kind of content and allow users to navigate between them without switching the context.","tabs":["Usage","Code","Interactions"],"showMobile":true},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Tabs\ndescription: Tabs segregate similar kind of content and allow users to navigate between them without switching the context.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Code', 'Interactions']\nshowMobile: true\n---\n\n### Variants\n\n<br />\n\n#### Basic tabs\n\nThis variation consists of only a label. \n\n<Preview name='basic-tabs'/>\n\n#### Tabs with Count\n\nThis variation uses the Pill component to display the count along with the label.\n\n<Preview name='tabs-tabs-with-count'/>\n\n#### Tabs with Icon\n\nThis variant consists of an icon along with the label.
