However, it is advisable to stack the radio buttons vertically with one option in a line for easier reading and scanning. If you need to use them horizontally, make sure to space the options appropriately so that it is clear which control goes with which label. \n\n<Preview name='alignment-of-radio-group'/>\n\n#### Overflow Behaviour \n\nIf the label or the help text with the radio component overflows, wrap it to the next line but make sure that the control and the label are top aligned.\n\n<Preview name='overflow-content'/>\n\n#### Default Selection\n\n<ul>\n  <li>If a radio group is optional to fill, no option from the list should be selected by default. </li>\n  <li>Even if the radio group is mandatory to fill, it is recommended not to have a default option selected in order to avoid submitting that option by mistake.
