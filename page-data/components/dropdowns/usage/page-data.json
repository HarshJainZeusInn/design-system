They provide the option to let users select a single option or multiple.\n\n### Structure\nDropdown is made up of 2 key components - a custom **button** which acts as a trigger and a **popover** which acts as a container for the options.\n\n![Dropdown structure](./images/dropdowns-1.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n### Types\nDropdowns can be categorized into **2 types** basis on their uses -\n\n#### Standard\nThis is the typical custom button + popover combination of dropdowns.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-all\"/>\n\n#### Menu\nThis is the icon button + popover combination of dropdowns which is used only for menu commands e.g. edit, export, delete, etc. This is **not used** for selecting options. The menu can open in either direction i.e towards left or towards the right.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-dropdown-as-menu\"/>\n\n### Variants\n<br/>\n\n#### Button variants\nThe custom button for dropdowns comes with a few variants -\n\n##### Standard\nThe standard variant consists of just text which changes its state when one or more options are selected.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-standard-dropdown\"/>\n\n##### With icon\nThis variant comes with an icon in the left preceding the text to provide additional cues regarding the type of the options.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-dropdown-with-icon\"/>\n\n##### Inline label\nThis variant comes with a label preceding the text and can be used at places where there is a space crunch.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-label-position-in-dropdown\"/>\n\n#### Options variants\nThe options in a dropdown can be single select or multi-select. They come with a few variants -\n\n##### Standard\nThis variant comes with just text.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-standard-dropdown\"/>\n\n##### With icon\nThis variant comes with an icon preceding the text.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-dropdown-items-with-icon\"/>\n\n##### With sub info\nThis variant comes with sub-info beneath the text.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-dropdown-items-with-icon\"/>\n\n##### With checkbox\nThis variant comes with the support of checkboxes to select single or multiple options. The options here can also have sub info just like the previous variant.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-dropdown-items-with-checkbox\"/>\n\n### Sizes\nDropdowns come in **2 sizes** - regular and tiny.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-variants-size\"/>\n\n### States\n<br/>\n\n#### Button states\nThe custom button comes in **5 states** - default, hover, focus, active and disabled.\n\n![States of the custom dropdown button](./images/dropdowns-2.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Options states\nThe options come in **3 states** - default, hover and selected. Users can also use the up/down arrow key to traverse the options. In that case, the highlighted option has the same state as hover.\n\n![States of options](./images/dropdowns-3.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n### Usage\n<br/>\n\n#### Search\nDropdown can be offered with a search functionality. In that case, the search input appears at the top.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-search-in-dropdown\"/>\n\n#### Multi select\nThe multi-select behavior in a dropdown is divided into **2 categories** as following.\n\n##### For options less than or equal to a threshold\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-dropdown-options-less-than-50\"/>\n\n![Multi-select behavior of dropdown for options less than or equal to a threshold](./images/dropdowns-4.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n##### For options more than the threshold\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-dropdown-options-more-than-50\"/>\n\n![Multi-select behavior of dropdown for options more than the threshold](./images/dropdowns-5.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n50 is the default threshold and it can be changed to any number between 50 to 100.\n<br/>\n\n#### Grouping options\nDropdown options can be grouped under a section using a sub header, if needed.\n\n![Grouping options under a sub heading](./images/dropdowns-6.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Label position\nThe label provides a better understanding of what kind of selection is expected. Labels can be placed either on the top of the dropdown or can be placed inline with the value or placeholder of the dropdown.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-label-position-in-dropdown\"/>\n\n#### Help text\nHelp text can be provided beneath a dropdown to add context regarding the type of input required just like the input fields.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-dropdown-with-caption\"/>\n\n#### Actions in footer\nUsing network resources on each checkbox selection in a dropdown can be quite expensive. To avoid sending api calls at every selection, the dropdown with multi-select comes with an option of having actions in the footer. This helps in sending the api call just once i.e. on click of Add/Apply button.\n<Preview name=\"dropdown-dropdown-with-action-buttons\"/>\n\n#### Custom trigger\nDropdowns can also be triggered by other components, primarily by buttons and icon buttons. The basic behavior of the dropdown remains the same.\n\n![Custom triggers to open a dropdown](./images/dropdowns-7.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Dropdown vs. Radio\nIt is recommended to use dropdowns if the number of single-select options exceeds 5 or if the space is limited, to better utilize the space. Radios should be used if the options are fewer than 5 and there are no space restrictions.\n\n![Dropdown vs. radio](./images/dropdowns-8.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Dropdown vs. Checkbox\nIt is recommended to use dropdowns if the number of multi-select options exceeds 5 or if the space is limited, to better utilize the space.
