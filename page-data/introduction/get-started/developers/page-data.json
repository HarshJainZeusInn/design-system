So it requires you to include CSS in your project by either importing or serving it as a static file. The complete stylesheet is published as part of the component library at path @innovaccer/design-system/css.\n\nImport style at your app's root.\n\n```shell\nimport '@innovaccer/design-system/css';\n```\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n##### Using font\n\nThe css sets the font family as 'Nunito Sans' for the body. To add this font in your project you need to load this font. The recommended way to do it is by adding the following google font cdn link to your app's head.\n\n```\n<link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito+Sans:300,300i,400,400i,600,600i,700,700i,800,800i,900,900i&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n##### Updating font\n\nIf you don't add the font described above font family will not be affected by css. However, if you want to update the font family update it via the following css variable.\n\n```shell\n--font-family\n```\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n##### Updating font\n\nAs BEM is used reset.css is not used and no style reset is done.\n\n<br />\n\n##### Polyfill for IE\n\nFor css variables to work on IE we use a polyfill at runtime to achieve dynamic theming through variables. Please add the following polyfill in your page.\n\n```shell\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/css-vars-ponyfill@2\"></script>\n<script>\n  cssVars({\n    onlyLegacy: true\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n#### Using components\n\nAvailable components along with live code editor and API documentation can be found here. Components can be imported as mentioned below.\n\n```javascript\n{\n...\nAvatar,\nBackdrop,\nBadge,\nBreadcrumbsWrapper,\nBreadcrumb,\n...\n} from '@innovaccer/design-system'\n```\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n#### How to run locally?\n\n<br />\n\n```shell\n#clone repository\ngit clone https://github.com/innovaccer/design-system.git\n\n#install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n#start development server\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n#### How to contribute?\n\nWe are happy that you wish to contribute to this project.
