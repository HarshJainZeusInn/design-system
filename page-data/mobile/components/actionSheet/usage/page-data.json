The more the actions, the higher the sheet would be. The height can go upto `93%` of the screen's height to accommodate the vast number of actions.\n\nIn case the actions are not accommodated within `93%` of the screen's height, show high-priority actions first, and the rest of the actions on scrolling.\n\n![Height of actions sheet](./images/actionsheet-3.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Number of actions\n\n**At least two actions** should be present when using an action sheet. For a single action item, use a button instead.\n\nIt is recommended to have a **maximum of 5-7 actions** in sheet to keep all the actions within reach. In case more actions are required, filter the actions, if possible, such that they can be accommodated within `93%` of the screen's height since users would have to scroll to reveal all actions. Scrolling adds up an extra step and may not be evident to everyone.\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Dismissal of action sheet\n\nInteracting with an action item closes the sheet. The sheet can be dismissed without interacting by tapping on the close icon button or tapping outside the sheet container.\n\n<img src='./images/actionsheet-4.gif' width='100%' height='auto'/>\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Title of the Action Item\n\nThe title of the Action Item should be concise and limited to a word or two.
