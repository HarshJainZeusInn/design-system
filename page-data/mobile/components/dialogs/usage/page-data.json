The data edited or changed through such screens require an action to either save or discard the changes.\n\nThe **Cancel button ( X )** present at the top left is used to return to the main flow.\n\n**Note:Since these types of dialogs take up the entire screen they are not suitable for screens larger than mobile screens.**\n\n<br/>\n\n<Card shadow='none'>\n  <Table\n    showMenu={false}\n    separator={true}\n    data={[\n      {\n        Property: 'Action',\n        Value: 'Close button, (Back button from 2nd step onwards)',\n        Configurable: '❌',\n      },\n      {\n        Property: 'Background color',\n        Value: 'Namak',\n        Configurable: '❌',\n      },\n      {\n        Property: 'Page transition',\n        Value: 'Single Step: Slide up (Bottom to top), Multi-Step: First Step - Slide up (Bottom to top), Subsequent Steps - Slide in (Left to right) from 2nd step onwards',\n        Configurable: 'Optional',\n      },\n    ]}\n    schema={[\n      {\n        name: 'Property',\n        displayName: 'Property',\n        width: '25%',\n        sorting: false,\n        separator: true,\n        cellType: 'DEFAULT'\n      },\n      {\n        name: 'Value',\n        displayName: 'Value',\n        width: '50%',\n        sorting: false,\n        separator: true\n        \n      },\n      {\n        name: 'Configurable',\n        displayName: 'Configurable?',\n        width: '25%',\n        sorting: false,\n        separator: true\n      },\n    ]}\n    withHeader={false}\n  />\n</Card>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\n##### Single step\n\nThese are the most basic type of full-screen dialogs, where there is only one step in the flow. \n\n<img src='./images/dialogs-4.gif' width='100%' height='auto'/>\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n##### Multi step\n\nFor cases where the transactions such as creating an entity take more than one step, stacking of the subpages is done.
