They are used to initiate actions and can have varying importance based on the need.\n\n### Types\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Primary\n\nPrimary buttons are used to describe the primary action on the page and hence only 1 primary button is allowed per screen. These types of buttons have the highest level of emphasis.\n\n![Primary button](./images/mbuttons-1.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Basic\n\nBasic button highlights the secondary action on the page. These buttons provide a lightweight button style while still maintaining affordability. \n\n![Basic button](./images/mbuttons-2.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Alert\n\nAlert buttons are used to highlight a high-impact destructive action.\n\n![Alert button](./images/mbuttons-3.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Label button\n\nLabel buttons have low emphasis and are generally used for less important actions. Give label buttons a negative offset equal to the left/right padding of the button to align them with the content they're used with.\n\n![Label button](./images/mbuttons-4.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Icon with label\n\nIcon with label adds additional visual cues in buttons. The icon can either precede the label or succeed it.\n\n##### Icon left\n\n![Icon left button](./images/mbuttons-5.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n##### Icon right\n\n![Icon right button](./images/mbuttons-6.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Icon button\n\nIcon button is used to optimize space, especially when the meaning of the icon is very clear.\n\n<br/>\n\n##### Transparent\n\n![Transparent icon button](./images/mbuttons-7.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n##### Basic\n\n![Basic icon button](./images/mbuttons-8.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n### Usage\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Horizontal Arrangement\n\nButtons should ideally be arranged horizontally whenever possible. In this type of arrangement, make sure that the buttons have equal width & the primary action is on the right side to reinforce the reading gravity.\n\n![Horizontal alignment](./images/mbuttons-9.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Vertical Arrangement\n\nThis type of arrangement is ideal when the label of the button is long and cannot fit in a half-width button. The width of the button here will be calculated in a manner that the button aligns with its parent. \n\nIn case of multiple buttons, place the primary button at the top to follow the common standards. \n\n![Vertical aligment](./images/mbuttons-10.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Multiple Label Buttons\n\nWhile using multiple label buttons in close proximity, make sure to space them properly so that the user can actually differentiate between them.\n\n![Multiple label buttons](./images/mbuttons-11.png)\n\n<br/>\n<br/>","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"93898c090374c649c5c078d761e4afde","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1610},"frontmatter":{"title":"Buttons","description":"Buttons initiate actions and indicate what will happen after interacting with them.","tabs":["Usage","Content"],"showMobile":true},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Buttons\ndescription: Buttons initiate actions and indicate what will happen after interacting with them.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Content']\nshowMobile: true\n---\n\nButtons are one of the crucial elements of a user interface.
