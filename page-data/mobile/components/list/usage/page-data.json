Lists present the content (text, supporting visuals, etc) in a consistent format to make them easily scannable. \n\n### Structure\nLists consist of rows called List Items. Depending on what the users need to get from your list UI design, the content of list items can take various forms: \n\n1. **Text**\n\n    *Primary* - It conveys the most important piece of information.\n\n    *Secondary* (optional) - It provides some additional information about the list item along with the primary text. It can either be a simple text or a meta-list. It is not recommended to use secondary text as the only text item. \n    \n    *Tertiary* (optional) - Tertiary text can either be simple text or a meta-list. It is not recommended to use tertiary text as the only text item.\n\n2. **Supporting visuals/anchor points** (optional) - They appear as the leftmost items and provide additional information about the list items e.g. avatars, icons, images, checkboxes.  \n3. **List controls** (optional) - They can display meta-information or actions for the list items e.g. metadata, icons, checkboxes, switches, etc.\n4. **Dividers** - They are great for distinguishing each item in the list. \n<br/>\n\n### Variants\nThe content of list items can come in following variants. All of these can be combined to get the desired results.\n\n#### Default\nThe default list item variant consists of just a single line of text, in order to convey the most important information.\n\n![Default list variant](./images/list-1.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### With secondary text\nThis variant comes with a secondary text just below the primary one.\n\n![List with secondary text](./images/list-2.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### With tertiary text\nThis variant comes with a tertiary text along with the secondary & primary text.\n\n![List with tertiary text](./images/list-3.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### With a supporting visual\nThis variant gives an option to have an icon, image, avatar or checkbox in the left just before the text starts.\n\n![List with a supporting visual](./images/list-4.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n### Usage\n#### List vs. Cards\nIn a list, every individual list item has a similar hierarchy and content i.e. all of them follow a template whereas there is no such pattern in cards. Cards act as containers which can have any type of content inside them.\n\n![List vs. Cards](./images/list-5.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Grouping\nSeveral list items can be grouped together under a section heading to accommodate other types of components (list, cards, etc.) on the same page.\n\n![Grouping a list under a section heading](./images/list-6.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Custom List Items\nAn empty list item can be used to design custom list items. One thing to keep in mind while designing a custom list item is that the padding inside the list item should be preserved.\n\n![Custom list items](./images/list-7.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n![Padding in an empty list item](./images/list-8.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Content\nAvoid excessively long lines of text in the list items as this can clutter the list and might increase the cognitive load. All the text layers should individually have either 1 or at most 2 lines of text.\n\n![Multiline text content should be limited in lists](./images/list-9.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"9bdb556ad8592ec9b9db772ab555a0e5","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1603},"frontmatter":{"title":"List","description":"A list consists of related content grouped together and organized vertically or horizontally.","tabs":["Usage"],"showMobile":true},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: List\ndescription: A list consists of related content grouped together and organized vertically or horizontally.\ntabs: [\"Usage\"]\nshowMobile: true\n---\n\nA list consists of related content grouped together and organized vertically or horizontally.
