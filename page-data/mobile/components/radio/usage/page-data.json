The label should clearly state the grouping category or the action to perform.\n\n**Note**: Minimum spacing between multiple options as well as the 1st option and group label should be `0px`.\n\n![Spacing in (Left)vertical vs (Right)horizontal radio group](./images/radio-5.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Options alignment\nThe options in a radio group can be aligned either verticallyorhorizontally.\n\n##### Horizontal\nFor horizontal arrangement, all the options of the radio group align horizontally in a single line. Make sure to space the options appropriately so that it is clear which control goes with which label. \n\nIf there are too many options it is not advisable to go for this type of arrangement because of less horizontal space available.\n\n![Horizontal aligned options in radio](./images/radio-6.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n##### Vertical\nFor vertical alignment, all the options of the radio group align vertically with one option in a line. This type of arrangement should be preferred over the horizontal arrangement for easier reading and scanning.\n\n![Vertical aligned options in radio](./images/radio-7.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Overflow behavior\nIf the label or the help text with the radio component overflows, wrap it to the next line but make sure that the control and the label are top aligned.\n\n![Overflow behaviour in radio](./images/radio-8.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Radio vs. checkbox\nCheckboxes allow users to select multiple options whereas radio allows only one selection from a list of mutually exclusive options.\n\n![(Left) Radio vs (Right) Checkbox](./images/radio-9.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Radio vs. dropdown\nRadio is recommended to use when there are fewer than 5-7 options as it is easier for users to compare and select the appropriate option and save an additional tap. \n\nHowever, if the number of options exceeds 5-7 or if the space is limited and the options can be collapsed then it is recommended to use dropdowns to utilize the space.\n\n![(Left) Radio vs (Right) Dropdown](./images/radio-10.png)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n#### Default selection\n* If a radio group is optional to fill, no option from the list should be selected by default.\n* Even if the radio group is mandatory to fill, it is recommended not to have a default option selected in order to avoid submitting that option by mistake. However, if the need arises you have the choice to make an option selected by default. In that case, make sure to select the safest and most likely option.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"5ad23efd05dd9b847a0ee156e471de41","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1598},"frontmatter":{"title":"Radio","description":"Radio lets users select one value from a list of mutually exclusive choices.","tabs":["Usage"],"showMobile":true},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Radio\ndescription: Radio lets users select one value from a list of mutually exclusive choices.\ntabs: [\"Usage\"]\nshowMobile: true\n---\n\nRadio lets users select *one value* from a list of mutually exclusive choices.
